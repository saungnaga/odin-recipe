    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put all ingredients for the paste in a blender or food processor.</li>
        <li>Add 50 ml coconut milk to help the blending process and blend until smooth.</li>

        <li>Cook over medium-high heat until the coconut milk get boiled.</li>
        <li>Adjust the heat into medium and simmer for 1.5 hours uncovered until the coconut milk becomes thicker and oily. Stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Add the tamarind water and salt to taste. (Note: If you like to eat it with sauce you can stop the cooking now. This dish is called: Kalio /Wet Rendang)</li>
        <li>If you like to eat it as rendang then continue cooking on low heat for about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cook until the coconut milk is driven off and the beef and sauce becomes brown and almost dry. (At this stage you will probably need to stir all the time to prevent burning)</li>
